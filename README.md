# DiscordBot

A bot I created to run on my own Discord server. The bot is created using JavaScript.
Features include:
- replying hello to a user when greeted.
- displaying bot and server information.
- creating polls with yes/no answers or multiple answers.
- rolling a random number between 1 and 100.
- more features to be added soon...

Feel free to copy and use any of the code for your own bots.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. To use this bot you need node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. After that, while inside your bot folder in a terminal(command prompt), run the two following commands:
- npm init
- npm install discord.js --save

2. You need to declare the token in the botconfig.json file as your own bot token (found on the discord website) in order to make your bot work.

3. While inside the bot folder in a terminal(command prompt), make the bot go online by typing:
- node .

4. Inside a text channel on your Discord sever, type !commands to get a list of all the bot's commands. Enjoy!

Feel free to message me if you have any questions!
